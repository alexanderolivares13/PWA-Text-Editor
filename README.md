## Description

This project was created to get a better understanding a Progressive Web Applications that are able to be installed as offline standalone apps. This challenge has taught me how to initialize a PWA as well as how to inject a manifest to my application as well as register a service worker. The project has overall taught me that PWAs although might have specific use cases, they are still something that could prove to be vital in those said situations.
